## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability within Universal Process Gatherer, please follow these steps:

### For Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **DO NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security details to: [security@example.com]
3. Include:
   - Description of the vulnerability
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Potential impact
   - Suggested fix (if any)

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 5 business days
- **Resolution Target**: Based on severity:
  - Critical: 7 days
  - High: 14 days
  - Medium: 30 days
  - Low: 60 days

## Security Considerations

### Required Privileges

This tool requires elevated privileges for full functionality:
- Linux: CAP_SYS_PTRACE capability or root access
- AIX: Similar elevated privileges
- Other platforms: Administrator/root access

### Data Sensitivity

Process information can be sensitive:
- Command-line arguments may contain passwords
- Environment variables may contain secrets
- Network connections reveal communication patterns
- File descriptors show accessed resources

### Best Practices

1. **Principle of Least Privilege**
   - Run with minimal required permissions
   - Drop privileges when possible
   - Use capabilities instead of root when available

2. **Secure Deployment**
   - Restrict access to the tool
   - Audit tool usage
   - Secure output files
   - Use encrypted channels for remote data

3. **Integration Security**
   - Validate all inputs
   - Sanitize outputs
   - Use secure communication protocols
   - Implement access controls

## Security Features

### Built-in Protections

- Memory-safe Rust implementation
- Input validation and sanitization
- Secure error handling (no information leakage)
- Configurable security analysis rules

### Security Analysis Capabilities

- Detects suspicious process behavior
- Identifies privilege escalation attempts
- Monitors for known attack patterns
- Customizable security rules
